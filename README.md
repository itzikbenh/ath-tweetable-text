# ath-tweetable-text
WordPress plugin for sharing via twitter parts of text.

## Requirements
1. Include font-awesome in your theme since it uses the fa-twitter icon.
2. Add this style to your theme - ```.twitter-share { color: #2EA3F2 !important; }``` I didn't want to create a stylesheet file just for changing one element :)
