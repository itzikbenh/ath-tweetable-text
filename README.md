# ath-tweetable-text
WordPress plugin for sharing via twitter parts of text.
There are other plugins that would do it for you. I wanted to make my own and make it simple as possible. 

## Requirements
1. Include font-awesome in your theme since it uses the fa-twitter icon.
2. Add this style to your theme for changing the color of the tinymce link icon - ```.twitter-share { color: #2EA3F2 !important; }``` I didn't want to create a stylesheet file just for changing one element :)
3. Open twitter-share-form.php and add your twitter handler as a default value in the "via" input element.
